Recursion Leap Year Checker
A simple application to check if a given year is a leap year using a recursive algorithm. This app demonstrates the use of recursion to solve problems efficiently.

Features
Takes a year as input and determines if it is a leap year.
Uses a recursive approach to check the conditions for leap years.
Can handle both positive and negative years.
How Leap Years Are Calculated
A year is a leap year if:

It is divisible by 4.
But it is NOT a leap year if it is divisible by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400.
For example:

2000 is a leap year (divisible by 4, 100, and 400).
1900 is not a leap year (divisible by 100 but not 400).
2004 is a leap year (divisible by 4 but not 100).
